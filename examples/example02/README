1) run 
   mc.x -inp1 cubic
2) add Jij  values in Parameters_Jij blocks of cubic.inp2.mcin file:
   
  Begin Parameters_Jij
   t1=  1:t2=  1:sh= 1:Jij= -0.01000!:sig=?????!:d= 2.00000000
   t1=  1:t2=  1:sh= 2:Jij= -0.00260!:sig=?????!:d= 2.82842712
  End Parameters_Jij
  

3) Uncomment any other parameters that you want to be calculated in Monte Carlo simulations.
   In this example uncomment Energy_write

4) run 
   mc.x -inp2 cubic
5) edit temperatures, supercell size according to what you want in cubic.mcin file. 
   To have better result, uncomment Pt and Pt_steps_swap 


6) run
   mc.x cubic


7) The program creates  cubic_energy-T*DAT files.
   By using mc-hist. x in the utility directory, you can create proper data files for histogram plotting.
   Please see user guide for more details.  

8) To see completely separated peaks in energy histograms, use a larger supercell (L>12).
