The program optimizes temperatures to make the acceptance ratio of swapping, 
in parallel tempering, becomes equal for all temperatures.

We use the following paper for this purpose:
Koji Hukushima, Physical Review E, 60, 3606 (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.60.3606)



The program needs python 3 and scientific python libraries: numpy, scipy and matplotlib.

To use this program, run a short MC simulation (for example with 100000-200000 steps) 
to obtain the energy of the system versus temperature.
Extract data from *_mc.dat file using the following command:

awk '{print $1,$3}' *_mc.dat > E.dat

E.dat file contains two columns. The first column is temperatures and the second column is energies:


1-To run the program, type:

   python  optimize_T.py 

   or

   python optimize_T.py --data E.dat --alpha 0.9 --epsilon 1e-8

2-The default name of data file is E.dat  

3-To get help type:

  python optimize_T.py -h  

=========================================================================================

In the case that this program doesn't work, use a program developed by Dr. Ruben Andrist:

https://github.com/andrist/tempering

The program works with the R language.
To prepare the input file for the program type the following commands:

   awk '{print $1,$3}' *_mc.dat  > E_andrist.dat 
   sed -i '/#/d'  E_andrist.dat 
   sed -i '1 i\T e' E_andrist.dat 


Then run the following command:

tempering.R  E_andrist.dat
